Small site for using custom sql database.

All sql settings located in sql/ directory and they runs from docker.

To run back-end + front-end, you need to do "npm install" on client/ and server/ and run "npm run dev" on client/ and server/.
Of course server needs to be runned after creating table and filing it with data.
